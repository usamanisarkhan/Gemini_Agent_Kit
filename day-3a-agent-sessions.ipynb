It's an area where the \"latest news\" is almost a daily occurrence.\n\nHere are some of the most prominent and recent developments:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n*   **What's new:** AI is moving beyond just analyzing existing data to actively *identifying* novel biological targets for diseases. By sifting through massive datasets (genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, clinical data), AI can uncover previously unknown pathways or molecules that play a crucial role in disease.\n*   **Examples:** Identifying new protein targets in cancer that are implicated in drug resistance or pinpointing genetic variations linked to neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Companies to watch:** Insilico Medicine, BenevolentAI, Exscientia.\n\n**2. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **What's new:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of just screening existing compound libraries, generative AI models can now *design entirely new molecules* from scratch, optimized for specific properties like binding affinity to a target, low toxicity, and good pharmacokinetic profiles (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted).\n*   **Examples:** AI designing de novo drug candidates for infectious diseases, rare genetic disorders, or chronic conditions that have proven difficult to treat with traditional methods.\n*   **Companies and Research:** NVIDIA's **BioNeMo** framework, **Atomwise**, and academic research labs are at the forefront.\n\n**3. Protein Structure Prediction and Drug Design:**\n*   **What's new:** Tools like **AlphaFold** (from DeepMind/Google) have revolutionized our ability to predict protein 3D structures with high accuracy. This is critical because drug efficacy often depends on how well a drug molecule fits into the active site of a target protein.\n*   **Examples:** Researchers can now more easily understand the shape of disease-related proteins, making it easier to design drugs that bind to them effectively. This accelerates the design of small molecule drugs and biologics.\n*   **Impact:** This has dramatically reduced the time and cost associated with experimental protein structure determination.\n\n**4. AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n*   **What's new:** AI is not just about finding the drug; it's also about getting it to patients faster and more efficiently. AI is being used to:\n    *   **Patient Recruitment:** Identify eligible patients for clinical trials more quickly and accurately.\n    *   **Trial Design:** Optimize trial protocols, predict success rates, and identify potential risks.\n    *   **Data Analysis:** Analyze trial data in real-time to make informed decisions.\n*   **Examples:** Using AI to predict which patients are most likely to respond to a particular treatment, thereby improving trial efficiency and success rates.\n\n**5. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n*   **Oncology:** AI is identifying new cancer targets, designing personalized cancer therapies based on tumor genetics, and predicting response to immunotherapy.\n*   **Neuroscience:** AI is accelerating the discovery of treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases by identifying novel targets and designing molecules that can cross the blood-brain barrier.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** With the ongoing threat of pandemics, AI is being used to rapidly identify potential antiviral and antibacterial compounds.\n\n**6. Use of Quantum Computing (Emerging):**\n*   **What's new:** While still in its early stages, quantum computing holds the potential to simulate molecular interactions with a level of accuracy and speed far beyond classical computers. This could unlock breakthroughs in understanding complex biological systems and designing highly specific drugs.\n*   **Companies Involved:** IBM, Google, and various startups are exploring quantum applications in drug discovery.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\nThe overarching theme is **acceleration and precision**. AI and related technologies are making drug discovery faster, more efficient, and more likely to succeed by enabling:\n\n*   **Discovery of novel targets** that were previously inaccessible.\n*   **Design of entirely new, optimized molecules.**\n*   **Better understanding of protein structures.**\n*   **More efficient and targeted clinical trials.**\n\nIf you're looking for very specific \"latest news,\" I'd recommend checking the press releases of companies like **Exscientia**, **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Insilico Medicine**, **BenevolentAI**, and **Schrödinger**, as they are often announcing new drug candidates entering preclinical or clinical trials, or partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**. This is a really exciting area because it represents a fundamental shift in how we approach the creation of new drugs.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what it entails and why it's so impactful:\n\n**The Core Idea: Designing \"From Scratch\"**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved two main approaches:\n\n1.  **Screening Libraries:** Taking existing collections of chemical compounds (millions of them) and testing them against a disease target to see if any \"fit\" and have the desired effect. This is like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n2.  **Rational Drug Design:** Based on a known understanding of a target's structure, chemists would design molecules to interact with it. This required significant prior knowledge and was still somewhat iterative.\n\n**Generative AI changes this by allowing computers to *create* new molecular structures that have never existed before, but are specifically designed to meet certain criteria.**\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\nGenerative AI models, often based on deep learning architectures like **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** or **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. Through this training, they learn the \"rules\" of chemistry – how atoms connect, what makes a molecule stable, and what chemical features are associated with desirable biological activity.\n\nOnce trained, these models can be prompted with specific requirements, such as:\n\n*   **Target Binding:** \"Design a molecule that strongly binds to this specific protein pocket.\"\n*   **Physicochemical Properties:** \"Design a molecule that is soluble in water, can cross cell membranes, and has a low molecular weight.\"\n*   **ADMET Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity):** \"Design a molecule with low predicted toxicity and good oral bioavailability.\"\n*   **Novelty:** \"Design a molecule that is chemically distinct from existing drug classes.\"\n\nThe AI then generates a list of novel molecular structures that are predicted to meet these requirements. These generated molecules are then typically synthesized in the lab and experimentally tested.\n\n**Why is this a \"Development\"?**\n\n1.  **Speed:** AI can generate and propose thousands or even millions of potential drug candidates in a matter of hours or days, a task that would take human chemists years.\n2.  **Novelty & Diversity:** AI can explore chemical space in ways that humans might not consider, leading to entirely new classes of drugs with novel mechanisms of action. This is crucial for tackling diseases where existing treatments are failing or resistance has emerged.\n3.  **Optimization:** AI can simultaneously optimize for multiple parameters (efficacy, safety, manufacturability) from the outset, rather than having to iterate through many rounds of modifications.\n4.  **Reduced Cost:** By rapidly identifying promising candidates and reducing the need for extensive, unfocused experimental screening, AI can significantly lower the cost of early-stage drug discovery.\n5.  **Handling Complexity:** For complex targets or diseases where our understanding is incomplete, generative AI can still propose viable candidates by learning patterns from diverse biological data.\n\n**Key Companies and Technologies:**\n\n*   **Exscientia:** One of the pioneers, they have a platform that uses AI to design molecules and has brought several AI-designed drugs into clinical trials.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for their end-to-end AI platform that covers target identification, molecule design, and clinical trial prediction. They have also advanced AI-designed drugs into human trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, focusing on predicting binding affinity.\n*   **Schrödinger:** While not purely generative in the same sense, their physics-based computational platform is used to design and optimize molecules, and they are increasingly integrating AI.\n*   **NVIDIA (BioNeMo):** Provides AI frameworks and tools specifically for drug discovery, including generative models for molecular design.\n*   **Various Pharmaceutical Companies:** Many large pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Merck) are building their own internal AI capabilities or partnering with AI drug discovery startups.\n\n**Challenges and Future:**\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI can propose molecules, but they still need to be synthesized and rigorously tested in the lab and clinic.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** Sometimes, it can be difficult to fully understand *why* an AI generated a particular molecule, which can be a concern for regulatory bodies.\n*   **Data Quality:** The performance of generative models heavily depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data.\n*   **Predicting Efficacy in Humans:** While AI is great at predicting binding and initial properties, predicting how a drug will perform in the complex human body remains a significant challenge.\n\nDespite these challenges, generative AI is undeniably revolutionizing the early stages of drug discovery, promising to bring new, more effective, and potentially life-saving treatments to patients much faster than ever before.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
